"""
Performance. In Section 8.6.2, we examined two basic ways of
iterating over a sequence: (1) by sequence item, and (2) via
sequence index. We pointed out at the end that the latter
does not perform as well over the long haul (on my system
here, a test suite shows performance is nearly twice as bad
[83% worse]). Why do you think that is?
