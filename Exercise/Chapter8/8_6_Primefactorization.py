"""
Prime Factorization. Take your solutions for isprime() and getfactors()
in the previous problems and create a function that takes an integer as input 
and returns a list of its prime factors. 
This process, known as prime factorization, should output a list of
factors such that if multiplied together, they will result in the original
number. Note that there could be repeats in the list. So if you
gave an input of 20, the output would be [2, 2, 5].
