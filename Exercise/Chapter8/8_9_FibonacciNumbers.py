"""
Fibonacci Numbers. The Fibonacci number sequence is 1, 1,
2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, etc. In other words, the next value of the
sequence is the sum of the previous two values in the sequence.
Write a routine that, given N, displays the value of the Nth
Fibonacci number. For example, the first Fibonacci number
is 1, the 6th is 8, and so on.
